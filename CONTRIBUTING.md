# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Fork the repo, make your change on a branch, and open a pull request. Only the maintainer merges to `main`.

## Setup

    make test
    make lint

You need Python 3.10 or newer. `make lint` also needs Claude Code. The dev container in `.devcontainer/` sets up both.

## Pull requests
- Keep each one to a single change, with tests.
- For new behavior, link the Claude Code doc it follows.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and docs when relevant.

## Working with AI agents
Agents are welcome. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` have the project's instructions, and `.claude/commands/` has common tasks. Say in your PR that an agent helped, and review the result yourself before submitting. You're responsible for what you submit.
