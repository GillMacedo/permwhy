# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Fork the repo, make your change on a branch, and open a pull request. Only the maintainer merges to `main`.

## Setup

    make test
    make lint

You need Python 3.10 or newer. `make lint` also needs Claude Code. The dev container in `.devcontainer/` sets up both.

## Pull requests
- PRs go through an automatic check before a person reads them: changes over 30 lines need a linked open issue (`Closes #<number>`), code changes need tests and a `CHANGELOG.md` line, `make test` must pass, and a PR can have at most 800 changed lines.
- Keep each one to a single change, with tests.
- For new behavior, link the Claude Code doc it follows.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and docs when relevant.
- Releases are automatic: a merge that changes what users install becomes a new version once its `CHANGELOG.md` lines are in. Docs and CI changes wait for the next one.

## Working with AI agents
Agents are welcome. `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` have the project's instructions, and `.claude/commands/` has common tasks. Say in your PR that an agent helped, and review the result yourself before submitting. You're responsible for what you submit.
